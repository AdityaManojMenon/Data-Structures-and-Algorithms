[Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Doubly%20Linked%20List) - This algorithm will transform a multilevel DLL into a single-level DLL.


[Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Sorting%20Algorithms) - This project implements the bubble, insertion, selection, and merge sort algorithms.


[Hash Tables](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Hash%20Tables) - Create a SessionsTable data structure that records when a user logs in. The SessionsTable will log the userâ€™s session by
generating a session ID. The SessionsTable will also be able to determine if a user was online during a certain time. It
is assumed a user is online for 60 minutes after each login.


[Circular Double-Ended Queues (Deque)](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Deque) - This algotithm is devised to take a pay period and work interval to maximize the profits you can make.


[AVL Trees](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/AVL%20Trees) - This code remove all stocks with a price to earnings ration of less a given threshold.


[Graphs](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Graphs) - An algorithm to find a route from point A to point B on the toll roads or the cheapest possible overall toll for your trip.
