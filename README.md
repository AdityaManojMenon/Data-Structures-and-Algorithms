[Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Doubly%20Linked%20List) - This algorithm will transform a multilevel DLL into a single-level DLL.


[Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Sorting%20Algorithms) - This project implements the bubble, insertion, selection, and merge sort algorithms.


Hash Tabled - Create a SessionsTable data structure that records when a user logs in. The SessionsTable will log the userâ€™s session by
generating a session ID. The SessionsTable will also be able to determine if a user was online during a certain time. It
is assumed a user is online for 60 minutes after each login.
